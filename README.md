# Efficient-Aerial-Land-Use-Mapping-via-Transfer-Learning.
Fine-tuned ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and MobileNetV2 on the UCMerced Landuse 21-class dataset.  Benchmarked models; MobileNetV2 offered best trade-off (91.1% accuracy, 54.2ms latency, 2.25M params). Performed Post-Training Quantization on MobileNetV2 to cut latency by 48.4% at 1.2% accuracy drop.
